##How to Write a Novel in Beat

This is a novel template for Beat. It works pretty much in the same way as screenplay mode: if it looks like a novel, it becomes novel.
Consecutive paragraphs are indented, while paragraphs with one empty line between them begin a new block. On iOS, novel mode doesn't add automatic dual line break after a paragraph.

.Scene markers

Take a look at the heading in *Preview Mode*. A scene (prefixed by a dot) adds # between paragraphs, but you can still see the scene heading text in the outline view. This can help structure your story.
###Subheadings

In novel mode, sections are visible elements, not just structure helpers. 
Top-level section (#) is pretty big, and always begins a new page. You can use it to separate larger acts. Second-level sections (##) begin a new page, but are a tad smaller, formatted like your usual chapter headings in novels. Third-level sections (###) and below are subheadings, and won't create a new page. 

##{{serial chapter}}. Advanced: Fun With Macros 

If you want to add an automatically incremented chapter number, macros make it very easy. Use curly brackets, keyword *serial* and a single-word macro name, for example: {{serial macroName}}. Now, every time you mention *macroName* in curly brackets in your text, the number will be one higher. Look: {{macroName}}, {{macroName}}, {{macroName}}!
Try it out yourself. You can see the result in preview mode. Beat manual (under *Help* menu) has a comprehensive tutorial about using macros.

##{{chapter}}. That's All

Everyone has at least one idea for a novel.
A proven method for writing a novel is to begin with a one-page synopsis, then start writing. First detail your character's actions, followed by how they feel, and after that, some loose associations â€“ repeated ad nauseam.
